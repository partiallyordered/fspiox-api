# Money

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**currency** | [**crate::models::Currency**](Currency.md) |  | 
**amount** | **String** | The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a canonical format that is restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons. This pattern does not allow any trailing zeroes at all, but allows an amount without a minor currency unit. It also only allows four digits in the minor currency unit; a negative value is not allowed. Using more than 18 digits in the major currency unit is not allowed. |
